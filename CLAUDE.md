# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Cadless.Lic is an HTTP/JSON licensing service built with C#/.NET web API. This is currently an empty repository with only a README.md file.

## Development Setup

This project appears to be in the early stages of development. When source code is added, typical .NET development commands will likely include:

- `dotnet build` - Build the project
- `dotnet run` - Run the application
- `dotnet test` - Run tests
- `dotnet restore` - Restore NuGet packages

## Architecture Notes

As this is currently an empty repository, the architecture will need to be established when the project code is implemented. Based on the description, this will be a web API service for handling licensing operations via HTTP/JSON.

## Repository Status

- Currently contains only README.md
- No source code, project files, or configuration present yet
- Project name has a typo in README.md ("Cadlles" instead of "Cadless")
